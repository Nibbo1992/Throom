    <!-- Chosen Palette: Stonework & Parchment -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured around a tab-based navigation system to provide rapid access to different facets of the character during a live game session. The default view is the 'Core Code' to constantly reinforce the character's foundational philosophy. The most crucial section is 'Interactive Scenarios,' which transforms the static tables into a quick-response tool: the user clicks a common in-game trigger (e.g., 'Ally is Hurt') and immediately gets Throom's detailed action protocol. This task-oriented design prioritizes speed and usability over the linear structure of the original document. Less frequently accessed, but still vital, information like 'Physicality/Voice' and the multi-step 'Rage Protocol' are organized into their own clear, easily digestible sections. This architecture is chosen to function as a performance tool, not a document to be read sequentially. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Core Axioms -> Goal: Inform/Reinforce -> Presentation: Prominent info cards -> Interaction: Static, always visible -> Justification: These are the core rules and must be front and center. | Report Info: Trigger/Response tables -> Goal: Organize/Inform on-demand -> Presentation: A grid of trigger buttons with a dynamic display area -> Interaction: Clicking a button populates the display with the corresponding response protocol -> Justification: This is the most efficient way for a player to find a specific reaction in the middle of a game. It's a quick-lookup system. | Report Info: Rage Protocol steps -> Goal: Organize/Show a Process -> Presentation: A horizontal stepper/flow diagram built with HTML/Tailwind -> Interaction: None, the visual flow communicates the sequence effectively -> Justification: Clearly visualizes the pre/during/post stages of this critical character moment. No charts or graphs are used as the data is entirely qualitative. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    <p class="text-slate-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto">Understanding Throom begins with the story of his failure and exile, which informs his absolute self-imposed code of duty and dishonor.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-white p-6 md:p-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg space-y-6">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 border-b-2 border-slate-300 pb-2">The Flaw Line</h3>
                    <p class="text-slate-700">Tholai was born into the Ogolakanu Clan, a singular Goliath community whose faith revolved around absolute, unmoving <strong>Serenity</strong>. As an apprentice stoneworker, he was taught that chaos was a betrayal of the spirit and that true strength was measured by unyielding peace. Yet, Tholai carried a terrifying, primal flaw: an uncontrollable <strong>Rage</strong> that felt like a flaw line in sacred stone. He struggled daily to contain the fury, knowing his very existence was an existential threat to his clan's beliefs.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 border-b-2 border-slate-300 pb-2">Stonebreaker</h3>
                    <p class="text-slate-700">The calamity came when raiders threatened the peaks. Tholai, losing control, unleashed his <strong>Rage</strong>. His fury crushed the enemy and saved his clan, but it simultaneously shattered the sacred silence and the stonework of his ancestral home. The Elders saw not a hero, but a spiritual failure—a contagion of chaos. The Chieftain gave him the shaming nickname <strong>"Stonebreaker"</strong> and cast him out, deeming him a liability whose reliance on brute force was a betrayal of their survival creed.</p>
                    <p class="text-slate-700 border-l-4 border-slate-400 pl-4 italic">Exiled and dishonored, Tholai rejected his full name. He adopted the blunt, simple moniker <strong>"Throom,"</strong> choosing a sound that was empty of honor or history, befitting a man who saw himself as a mere weapon—a self-imposed punishment that affirmed his tragic code: "My strength is weakness. My serenity is rage. My duty is dishonor".</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 border-b-2 border-slate-300 pb-2">The Quest for the Purest Evil</h3>
                    <p class="text-slate-700">Throom wandered the lands, using his terrifying strength only to uphold the duty he could not fulfill among his own kin: the protection of the innocent. However, Throom realized that helping common folk was insufficient penance; it did not justify the inherent dishonor of his existence. He became obsessed with a singular, terrible purpose: finding an evil so profound, so utterly corrupting, that his own contaminated power would be the only fitting weapon. He sought out <strong>Barovia</strong>, viewing its dark master, Strahd, as the ultimate problem that requires the ultimate, violent solution—<strong>The Purest Evil</strong>. He seeks to use his <strong>Rage</strong> to shatter this despair, offering his own destruction as the final, necessary sacrifice to achieve ultimate, paradoxical redemption.</p>
